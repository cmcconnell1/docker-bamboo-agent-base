# CA Key and Certificate:
# A new Certificate Authority is created (ca.key, ca.crt).
# Agent Certificate:
# 
# A private key and certificate signing request (CSR) are generated for the agent.
# The agent's certificate is signed by the CA.
#
# DigiCert Root Certificate:
# The root certificate from DigiCert is downloaded (you can replace this part with your own file if needed).
# PFX Creation:
# 
# Finally, the .pfx file is created, containing the agent certificate, CA certificate, and DigiCert root certificate, protected by a password (YourPasswordHere).
